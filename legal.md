This is the legal page for Algostats.

## The service

Algostats is an open-source service aiming to give general statistics about each promotion results at their algorithm homework assignments.
The service has been created to archive results and provide general statistical information to students.

The service is operated by [Matiboux](https://matiboux.me/), the project creator.


## Cookie usage

By using Algostats, you allow us to create and use cookies for analytics purposes.


## Data usage

Algostats uses anonym data to generate the statistics. Full anonym datasets are required for the service to operate as intended.

### Source

The data came from dumps of a _public folder_ containing all students results, as published by members of the school — EPITA.

This data — the original dumps — was originally not anonymized.

For publication here on Algostats, the data has been pseudonymized.

### Public data

The public data, as published on Algostats, is anonymized by default.

The data of a student can be de-anonymized, on request of the conserned student and with his explicit consent.

### Private data

In order to process requests, and as meant by the data pseudonymization, additionnal data — the original dumps — is kept privately by the project manager.

This additionnal data can be deleted on request of the conserned student. Without any request of that kind from the conserned student, the data is kept privately in case of any future request.

For any request, the project manager can be [contacted by email](mailto:mathieu.guerin@epita.fr).
